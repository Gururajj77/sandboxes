# Carbon Design System Sandboxes

[![daily builds](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/sandboxes/actions/workflows/daily-builds.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/sandboxes/actions/workflows/daily-builds.yml)

This repository houses a collection of sandboxes to be used in online editors
such as stackblitz.

These can be used for bug reproductions and explorations across different
versions of key dependencies such as react.

Sandboxes are organized by top-level frameworks such as react and
web-components. React can use any variety of react frameworks such as vite,
nextjs, gatsby, remix, etc. for different testing or reproduction purposes.

## Local development

Each sandbox can be ran locally, instructions are provided in the sandbox
`README.md`.
