/*
  This sandbox uses a precompiled version of `carbon-component` styles 
  served via unpkg.

  If you'd like to enable live sass compliation of Carbon styles:
    1. Uncomment the line below with the @use declaration
    2. Remove the <script> tag loading carbon-component css in index.html
   
  Please note that Sass compliation can take some time, particularly 
  in resource-constrained environments such as stackblitz.
